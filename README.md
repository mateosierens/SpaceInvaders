# SpaceInvaders
Project Space Invaders 2nd Bachelor Computer Science University of Antwerp

Press Q key to move left and D key to move right. At the start of the game you are granted 3 lives, these are passed through the levels,
(so you don't get new lives at the start of a new level), and when these reach 0 it's GAME OVER. To win the game you must defeat all
the enemy "ships" by shooting bullets with the space bar. You can only have 1 bullet on the screen at once, while enemies can have multiple
bullets at once, so you need to aim correctly or you will have to wait for a bullet to fall out of the screen before you get a new one.
If you fail to defeat the enemies before they reach you it is also a GAME OVER. Good luck!
